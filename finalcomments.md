# Comments
You had good comments throughout that gave a sense of both what you were trying to accomplish and why.

# Code Quality
You did really well at doing things like figuring out ways to count out characters in order to make the shapes. The code itself is straightforward and error-free as well.

The output comes fairly close to what you would expect from a Twitter bot, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more from the project, some potential user interaction, for example.

# Ambition
In your README you talk about the big picture of the project and your desire for visual impact as well as raising awareness of an issue that doesn't always get much attention. I also appreciate the specificity of your README: you did really well at giving a sense of what your challenges were and how you decided what to implement and what to jettison.
