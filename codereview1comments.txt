The ASCII art is great, and I'm really excited to see where this project goes, and how this fits into all of it. I am concerned, however, that there's not yet any actual code as requested by the code review and no documentation of what this program is going to do. You still have time, but you need to have a real conversation with me during the next workshop about what kinds of functionality you should start with in order to get this project off the ground.
