Approximately 100,000-200,000 animals suffer and die just for cosmetics every year around the world
Rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats and mice are the most commonly used animals
#BeCrueltyFree campaign is the largest and most effective initiative in the world to end cosmetics animal cruelty
Animals also suffer and die in classroom biology experiments and dissection
Mice, rats, birds, and cold-blooded animals who make up more than 99 percent of animals used in experiments are not covered by even the minimal protections of the Animal Welfare Act and therefore go uncounted
At least 115 million animals may be used in experiments worldwide each year
Its estimated that the top 9 animal testing countries in the world are the USA, Japan, China, Australia, France, Canada, the UK, Germany and Brazil
