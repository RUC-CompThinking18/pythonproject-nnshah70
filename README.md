I started this project hoping to make it into a twitter bot that would randomize facts in response to certain
hashtags that it found on twitter. After starting the code I realized that it was not visually appealing. As
a visual learner myself, I decided on this idea of putting short facts in the shape of a bunny with ears made
up of unicodes. Visually speaking it adds to the impact of the facts and leaves people with a memorable way to
view these otherwise saddening facts. I came up with the idea to share facts about animal testing because I foster
guinea pigs as well as rescue them when they are abandoned. Many people do not take these animals seriously and really
do just believe they are better off as "test animals" for products on the market in general. Purchasing makeup
changed for me after I began saving these small creatures, I saw their fear, their emotions and their pain and
recognized the inhumane deaths they suffer in regards to animal testing, as guinea pigs, rates and mice are usually
the breed of choice. I began opting for brands that were stated to be cruelty free. That is what spurred me to choose
this topic for the project, because it a topic that is not discussed or shared often, like topics of mental health
or suicide. There is not much awareness brought to animal testing that is not cruelty free.

Getting the unicodes to print was the easiest part other than the fact I spent so much time actually counting the
spaces by hand in order to get both ears equally spaced and in line. I have struggled with the coding functions and writing
the codes since day 1, and therefore it took me much longer to even write simple codes. I did not even figure out how to get the
facts to shuffle and randomize until I seeked help from a comp sci major. Getting the facts to join and split line by line was
trial and error, joining the str functions by changing the numbers until all the lines fit. The part of the project I was trying
to achieve was to get each line to start after a certain number of spaces and only have a certain number of characters. I was
able to figure out the function to count the spaces and characters but I was not able to figure out how to create the half circle
shape of the rabbit head. My vision for the project was to make it in a way where people could change how large the bunny printed
and input any facts they wanted to as well as change the character count of each line to where they see fit. I believe I needed
to count the characters of each line and somehow join them in the same way I joined the words but I could not seem to find functions
online that I could use as a guide. With more coding experience this project should've been easier, but every task proved to be a
challenge to write. I was truthfully just happy to see the function run, and get it to randomize the facts. I actually am
going to keep working on this until i get the head the way i want it into the shape i imagined. I just enjoyed the ability
to make it a more visual project when it printed to the terminal.
